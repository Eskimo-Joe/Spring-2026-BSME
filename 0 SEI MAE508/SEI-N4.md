PDR is when design is 15% complete

functional requirements
Systems engineering engine

Repeats lecture 3 slides
explains the heirarchy and iterative process between requirements, functional analysis, and system synthesis

started lecture 4 slides

useful explanations of "functions" slides 7-11

Elements of functional analysis
- f. decomp
- f. sequencing
- information/data flow
- interface definition

Boeing 767 functional analysis

tech fellows can be higher paid than managers
FA = functional analysis

IDEF diagrams
Integrated Definition for Functional Modeling
IDEF0 - IDEF5
SE only uses IDEF0

Orion docking example

IDEF5 type classification
description subsumption: polygon can be triangle, hexagon, or rectangle
natural kind classification: metal can include aluminum, iron, or copper

N2 diagrams

Func Architecture can be produced from Functional Flow Block and IDEF0 diagrams

Systems can now be broken down into subsystems while functions are assigned to subsystems. This supports the design of each subsystem

Now we can start design synthesis

FA = functional architecture

class exercise 2:
functional decomp: only to third level
- Func flow block diargram of system
- functional architecture
- deveop system architecture through functional allocation


compare FA and IDEF0


exercise 3 will be trade study
