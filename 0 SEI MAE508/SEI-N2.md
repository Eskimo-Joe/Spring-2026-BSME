systems engineering works to manage a large engineering project

starts talking about business
how to decide to buy sell or hold

four metrics
- revenue growth
- net margin
- operating cash flow
- return on net assets

actions 
- meet customer requirements
- validate and verify requirements

SE emphasizes to do things right the first time to prevent losses of waste

global business environment
technology is a common commodity in most cases
the winner is who can: 
- deliver the best quality
- be the first to deliver product to the market
- sell at the cheapest price
challenges are cost and schedule

**current business reality**
- significant development failures and project cancellation due to the absence of:
	- adequate upfront planning
	- adequate scope definitions
	- understanding customers intent, expectations and requirements definition

[GAO report](https://csulb.instructure.com/courses/117159/modules/items/6663458)
discusses an example where schedule delays led to a billion wasted on a DOD order
a technician wrongly installed some fasteners into a satellite leading to an 18 month delay

who is the customer of most engineers
usually the business employing them

**customer inhibitiors**
isolation from real "user" 
customers not knowing what they want
undocumented system / project cope leading to scope creep
not clear understanding of customer values

**management inhibitors**
executive management not buying in
lack of teamwork
program manager not empowered
program manager overpowered
lack of upper management support - lack of understanding

an old chief engineer told him "don't come to me with problem unless you have a solution"

the later the change is made the more expensive it is

quote from assistant secretary of USAF and secretary of defense '03-'04

systems engineering and project management have high synergy
venn diagram

systems engineering begain in the late 1950s
- race to space and nuclear missles were essentiail for survival
- emphasize system performance - mission success
- emphasize project management - technical performance, delivery schedule, and cost control

due to Sputnik and ICBM in 1957

RW company
person funded systems engineering
"Rieman" also stated social technical  - Sam Ramo
cake example for systems engineering

a driving force for high system reliability introduced the following changes:
- parts traceability
- materials and process control
- change control
- product accountability
- formal interface control
- requirements traceability

met a guy in hawaii with phd who was a taxi driver

in the 80s systems engineering died due to low government contract work

90s revitalized systems engineering which is when Hsu worked at Boeing

evolution of systems engineering
...

usually ConOps are developed by customers but they dont always have the resoures to
so boeing started an operations research and analysis team with a big theatre

"systems systems engineering"
not within scope of this class because of emergent behavior
a systems system is like a classroom full of students cooperating and each student is also a system

systems engineering is not rocket science but may be harder than rocket science since it deals with people

from womb to the tomb and cradle to the grave

real life examples of systems engineering
scheduling - showing up on time
trade studies - choosing a significant other
choosing which house to buy 

a good problem solver and welcome challenges
well grounded technically with broad interests
analytical and systems
...

USAF started to merge systems engineering and integration
SEIT - systems engineering and integration team
IPT - integrated product team / the different departments in the company

what is a system
a set of interrelated components working together as an integrated whole to achieve a common objective
an integrated composite of people, products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objectives

yapping about salad

heirarchy chart consists of a tree of how components mate together

system understanding
objective and function
purpose and goal
static or dynamic
open or closed
control, structure, complexity, origin

class exercise, started discussing group projects
