velocity analysis
reference frames
Reaction at A: $\vec{R}_{A}$
Reaction at at B measured from A: $\vec{R}_{B/A}$

translational: R is changing with respect to time and theta is constant
rotational: R is constant and theta changes with time
general: R changes and theta changes with time


Solving a velocity problem:
given: a, b, c, d, $\theta_{2}$, $\theta_{3}$, $\theta_{4}$, $\delta_{3}$, $\omega_{2}$
unknowns: $\omega_{3},\omega_{4}, \vec{V}_{A},\vec{V}_{B},\vec{V}_{C}$

start with input L2
$$\vec{V}_{A}=a \dot{\theta}e^{j(\theta_{2}+\pi/2)}$$
$$| \vec{V}_{A}|=a\omega_{2}$$
$$\angle \vec{V}=\theta_{2}+\frac{\pi}{2}$$
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ because the velocity is 90 degrees from the position vector

$$\vec{V}_{B}= \vec{V}_{A}+\vec{V}_{B/A}$$

use $|V|=r\omega$ and solve for $\omega$ for scenarios

fourbar mechanism
given: a, b, c, d, $\theta_{2}$, $\theta_{3}$, $\theta_{4}$, $\omega_{2}$
unknowns: $\omega_{3}$, $\omega_{4}$, $V_{A}$, $V_{B}$, $V_{C}$
$I_{13}$ is the intersection of lines 2 and 3, $I_{12}$ and $I_{23}$ etc are joints

centrode is when intersection point is on a fixed joint

If centrode exists on the ground link then the mechanism can be changed to a cam and follower
