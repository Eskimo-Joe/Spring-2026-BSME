groups of 4
lab format: AIAA format
due two weeks after lab date
only one submission per group on canvas
should not be obvious its AI generated
speak in past tense

Final exam
one question based on each experiment free response
about 10 multiple choice questions

gas calorimetry experiment:
capsule "reactor vessel" connected to bunsen burner while measuring fuel usage. flow water through vessel and measure temperature change. also measure temperature of exterior and shell interior

bomb calorimetry:
1" thick stainless with diesel fuel

power plant design is more relevant than heat transfer
may generate Ts or Pv diagrams
