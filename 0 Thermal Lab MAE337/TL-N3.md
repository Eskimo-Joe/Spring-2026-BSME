Bomb Calorimetry

uses solid fuel instead of fluid fuel

three bomb calorimeters: blue white and black

multiple runs, 6 trials total

$$\Delta H=\frac{m_{H_{2}O} \bar{c}_{p}\Delta T}{m_{fuel}}\,\left[ \frac{E}{m_{f}} \right]$$
energy per mass of fuel

not a steady state system
the calorimeter will be in a water bath
the vessel will be submerged in water with fuel inside

precalculate $mc_{p}$
combination of heat of water + heat of bomb + negligible components

thermal mass: $m_{H_{2}O}c_{p}=W$ 

calorimeters either IKA or Parr New or Parr old

$$HHV=\frac{W_{IKA,parr}\Delta T-e_{1}-e_{2}-e_{3}}{m_{fuel}}+e_{4}+e_{5}$$

correction for sulfur: $e_{2}=0$
correction for nitrogen: $e_{1}\,\left[ cal \right]=\frac{5}{9}V_{\ce{ Na_{2}Co_{3} }}$
correction for ignition (for parr calorimeter): $e_{3}[cal]=2.3\,\left[ \frac{cal}{cm} \right] \cdot L\,[cm]$
correction for ignition (for IKA calorimeter): $e_{3}=50J\cdot (\text{per thread})$
correction for constant volume instead of constant volume:
$e_{4}=V(P_{f}-P_{i})=-22 \frac{cal}{g_{fuel}}$
thermodynamic correction: $e_{5}=mc_{p}\Delta T=3.94(T_{f}-T_{i})$


measure nitric acid in bomb washings by titrating a basic solution ($\ce{ Na_{2}Co_{3} }$)

energy added for ignition is length of fuse wire in cm times 2.3
for IKA calorimeters its just 50J per thread

cp:
$$HHV=H_{p}-H_{r}$$
cv:
$$Q=\Delta U=U_{p}-U_{r}$$
measuring Q not HHV, so convert using
$$HHV=U_{p}-U_{r}+V(P_{f}+P_{i})$$
but no pressure measurement can be taken
$$P_{f}=\frac{n_{f}}{n_{i}}P_{i}$$
$$n_{i}=\frac{P_{i}V}{RT_{i}}$$
$$\ce{ CH_{2.1} + 1.525O_{2}\to CO_{2} + 1.05 H_{2}O }$$
$$n_{fuel}=\frac{m_{f}}{14.1 \frac{g}{mol}}$$

fuel will be diesel fuel

time b is at 60% of max temp change

$$T_{b}=T_{a}+.6(T_{c}-T_{a})$$
$$t_{b}=t_{@T_{b}}$$

$$T_{a,corrected}=T_{a}+r_{1}(t_{b}-t_{a})$$
$$T_{c,corrected}=T_{c}+r_{2}(t_{c}-t_{b})$$
$$\Delta T_{corrected}=T_{c,c}-T_{a,c}$$

$$LHV=HHV-\frac{m_{cond}h_{fg@Ta}}{m_{fuel}}$$
$$m_{condensate}=n_{H_{2}O}\times18 \frac{g}{mol}$$

## 02-18


three calorimeters will all be ran twice
Parr calorimeters will ignite with a length of cotton thread

fuel mass will always be 1g
scales have accuracy of $\pm 5g$

careful with crucible
dont put down the bomb with crucible
cotton thread has to be tied around heating element NiCr wire

assemble bomb carefully to not spill

we will add pressureized Oxygen
edit: will use 25atm instead of 30atm

IKA will fill itself with with water
Parrs need precisely 2L of water

record every minute until 5mins
ignition at 5min
after 6min, record every .25min or 15sec
at 8mins, record every min until 18

depressurize the bomb

wash the crucible and do titration step (explanation later)

Parr - cut NiCr wire to about 10cm, tie to both electrodes and dip center into fuel
IKA - cotton thread
