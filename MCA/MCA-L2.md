Hal Levison - genius behind the following Mission Concept
Principal investigator for Lucy mission

"Trojan" groups of asteroids the follow and lead Jupiter's orbit
"Lagrange Point" is $\pm 60^{\circ}$ 
they are primordial in age 

 visited asteroids in the asteroid belt first as test cases
then 5 Trojan asteroids planned in the future

many spacecraft have visited asteroid belt asteroids, but never trojans

the lack of small orbital periods of large asteroids leads scientists to believe that spinning at that rate breaks the asteroids
