class can be considered Control systems 1, since control systems is a dense class. 

start by modeling systems by writing transfer functions

will cover mechanical, electrical, and thermal systems

phys 152 is a newly added prerequisite

"easier than dynamics"
review of mathematics

she does cool research with soft robotics

only 1 midterm exam

late assignments penalized 20% per day

Lecture

what is a dynamics system?
a system that changes over time
examples:
- solar system
- the atmosphere
- the economy
- the human body
- ecology
- cancer growth
- spread of epidemics
- chemical reactions
- the electrical power grid
- the internet

mathematical modeling of mechanical and electrical systems
examples, spring damping system 
$$m \dot{\dot{x}}+c \dot{x}+kx=F$$
