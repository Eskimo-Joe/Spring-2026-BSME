mechanical systems

moving parts
physical systems can be static or dynamic

static depends on only current situation without memory
dynamic systems depend on time and have memory

lots of first order ODE

$$\dot{x}=\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x(t),u(t),t)$$

x = state vecot
u = control input vector
basic elements of mechanical systems
three passive, linear components
- a
- b
- c

linear or rotational motion
mass energy sotrage element (spring) - kinetic energy
$$F=m \ddot{x}$$

inertia
$$\text{Torque}=J\alpha=J \ddot{\theta}$$
potential energy
$$F=k(x-x_{0})$$
$$T=k(\theta-\theta_{0})$$
k is spring stiffness 

viscous damper: energy dissipative element
$$F=c \dot{x}$$
$$T=D \dot{\theta}$$
c and D are damping coefficient

free body diagrams

stick to x and its derivatives

$$\sum F=F-kx-c \dot{x}=m \ddot{x}$$
$$m \ddot{x}+c \dot{x}+kx=F$$

friction $$F=m \ddot{x}-c \dot{x}$$
